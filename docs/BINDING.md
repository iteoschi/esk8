# Binding

Binding creates a unique radio address for each remote/board pair.

How to see if you need binding
- If RF does not connect or you have multiple boards/remotes nearby, run binding.

Binding steps
1) Go to Settings mode (long press trigger with neutral throttle).
2) Navigate to BIND and short press.
3) Keep the remote near the board until RF OK appears.

Notes
- Binding uses the fixed binding address and the configured channel.
- The board only accepts binding when speed is low and throttle is neutral.
- The new address is saved on both sides and reused after reboot.
